Given a list of numbers, see if you can separate them in to k groups such that each group has the same sum.  

Examples:
```
Input: list = {2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4}; k = 3
Output: true
This list can be split into three groups [2,5], [1,6], [3,4] of equal sum.

Input: list = {2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 8}; k = 4
Output: true
This list can be split into four groups [2,7], [1,8], [4,5], [6,3] of equal sum.

Input: list = {2, 1, 14, 5, 6, 16, 21, 3, 9}; k = 3
Output: false
This list can be split into three groups of equal sum.
```
